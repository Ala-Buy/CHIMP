# CHDK Utility

A Windows utility for installing/updating CHDK.

It's intended as a somewhat friendlier alternative to [STICK](http://www.zenoshrdlu.com/stick/stick.html). If you're a happy STICK user, you may stop reading.

Following are inexhaustive lists of advantages and disadvantages (mostly vis-a-vis STICK) and limitations (mostly shared with STICK).

## Pros:

+ Easier to use
+ Doesn't require Java
+ Doesn't require special permission handling
+ Doesn't require [special image handling](http://www.zenoshrdlu.com/stick/stickextra.html)
+ [Free as in freedom](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt)

## Cons:

- Windows only
- Requires .NET Framework 4.5.2

## Limitations:

- Little code to show off (needs cleanup)
- Requires administrator permissions (general Windows issue)
- Doesn't handle multiple partitions on [Windows 10 Creators Update](https://thewincentral.com/windows-10-creators-update-allows-multiple-partitions-usb-drive/)
- Doesn't handle cards larger than 32GB ([general Windows issue](http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/guiformat.htm))
- Doesn't allow images dropped from non-administrator applications ([general Windows issue](https://superuser.com/questions/59051/drag-and-drop-file-into-application-under-run-as-administrator))
