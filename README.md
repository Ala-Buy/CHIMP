# CHDK Utility

A Windows utility for installing/updating CHDK.

## Pros:

+ Easier to use
+ Doesn't require Java
+ Doesn't require special permission handling
+ Doesn't require special image handling
+ Free as in freedom (GPLv2)

## Cons:

- Windows only
- Requires .NET Framework 4.5.2

## Limitations:

- No code to show off yet (needs cleanup)
- Doesn't handle multiple partitions
- FAT32 cards cannot be larger than 32GB (general Windows issue)
- Images can only be dropped from applications running under admin privileges (general Windows Vista or later issue)
